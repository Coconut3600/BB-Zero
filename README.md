BB‑Zero is an AlphaZero‑style neural network for Spanish checkers, using PUCT, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Dirichlet noise, temperature, and pure self‑play reinforcement learning with no heuristics.
The first full version of the program was completed on January 16, 2026, and the next phase now begins: building all training datasets from scratch. I will document this entire process in this blog as the project evolves.
In the future, once BB‑Zero becomes more stable and mature, I plan to release the full source code so others can study it, reproduce it, or build upon it.

Special thanks to Herson P. Guier, my consultant and rule expert, whose deep knowledge of Spanish checkers has been essential to this project.
